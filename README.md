# LLM-Chatbot

 LLM-Based Chatbot with RAG Pipeline (Prototype)
Overview
This project demonstrates the design and development of an intelligent chatbot system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It simulates enterprise use cases such as document-based Q&A, internal knowledge assistance, and scalable chatbot workflows for SaaS platforms.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: OpenAI GPT-3, spaCy, FAISS, Pandas, Streamlit

Concepts: LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Semantic Search, Embedding Models, Vector Similarity, Chatbot UX/UI

Objectives
Combine the strengths of pre-trained LLMs and custom document retrieval for grounded, factual responses.

Build an interactive chatbot interface with seamless integration of backend retrieval + generation logic.

Ensure context relevance, low response latency, and explainable AI behavior.

 Implementation
 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Created a small domain-specific document corpus (PDFs and plain text) simulating enterprise knowledge.

Preprocessed and cleaned textual data using spaCy, removing noise and normalizing tokens.

 2. Embedding & Semantic Search
Generated vector embeddings for each document chunk using spaCyâ€™s transformer-based vectors.

Indexed these embeddings using FAISS for high-speed approximate nearest-neighbor search.

 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
On each user query:

Retrieved top-n relevant document chunks via FAISS similarity search.

Constructed a context-aware prompt by combining the query with retrieved content.

Sent the prompt to OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating final user-facing answers.

4. User Interface
Built an interactive frontend using Streamlit for real-time chat interactions.

Displayed retrieved context and model responses for transparency and explainability.

 Results & Features
Achieved accurate and context-grounded responses even with limited training data.

Enabled explainable AI by showing both the source context and generated answer.

Optimized for low-latency, single-session query resolution.

Built-in scalability potential with modular design for easy expansion to cloud deployments.

 Key Takeaways
RAG significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLM outputs by grounding generation in external knowledge.

FAISS + spaCy offers a lightweight, fast retrieval stack for custom NLP tasks.

Streamlit enabled rapid prototyping and an intuitive UX for AI applications.
